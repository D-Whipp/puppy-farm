## Purpose

I made Puppy Farm after completing the first section of a [Udemy](https://www.udemy.com/) course taught by [Jonas Schmedtmann](https://www.udemy.com/user/jonasschmedtmann/). The first section taught routes made with vanilla JavaScript. I made my custom route which can be accessed from the single card puppy page and will take you to the selected puppy's wikipedia page.

## Usage

- Download the source code to use this app.
- Using your terminal, navigate to Puppy Farm's root directory.
- Run 'npm i' to install dependencies
- Run 'Node Index.js'
- Open your browser of choice.
- Type 'localhost:5500' into the URL and press 'Enter'.
- The site will load on your local machine.
- From there you can click on the buttons to navigate through the site.
